      <h2> CHILDREN'S MIRACLE NETWORK HOSPITALS </h2>
      <p> Children's Miracle Network Hospitals® raise funds and awareness for 170 member hospitals that provide 32 million treatments each year to kids across the U.S. and Canada. Donations stay local to fund critical treatments and healthcare services, pediatric medical equipment and charitable care.
      </p>

    <p1> Since 2008, Extra Life has raised more than $40 million for member hospitals. More than 10 million kids enter Children's Miracle Network Hospital across North America every year. To provide the best care for kids, children’s hospitals rely on donations and community support, as Medicaid and insurance programs do not fully cover the cost of care. Since 1983, Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals has helped fill those funding gaps by raising more than $5 billion, most of it $1 at a time through Miracle Balloon icon campaigns. Extra Life is among various programs that support the nonprofit’s mission to save and improve the lives of as many children as possible.
